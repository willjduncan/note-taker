## Description

AS A small business owner

I WANT to be able to write and save notes

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete


<!-- Team-Profile-Generator is a program that allows the user to set up a workforce list consisting of employees, managers, engineers, and interns. The creation of the program is intended to test and improve my skills using ES6, Node, Jest, and npm, while also giving me a chance to plan and form a project using an object-oriented approach that prioritizes testing first. By the end of the challenge, I should feel more comfortable and equipped to work on back-end development in a professional setting.  -->

Once complete, the program should operate so that:

GIVEN a note-taking application

WHEN I open the Note Taker

THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page

THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text

THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

WHEN I click on the Save icon

THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column

THEN that note appears in the right-hand column

WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page

THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column


<!-- The final product should place however many members of the workforce there are into their own individual cards with active links on a webpage. 

This project had to be accomplished with careful planning, first setting up the necessary scaffolding according to the Challenge guidelines, then downloading the necessary tools, including npm, inquirer, and Jest. From there, the tests had to be established for each Class, before any building of the Classes could commence. I started the classes with Employee and then moved on to the others, using Jest-Another-RPG as a blueprint for extending the "Employee" functionality to the other classes. I then set up the inquirer to ask the pertinent questions and store the items. I realized it may be easier to set up that functionality within a class, similar to how there was a Game class in Jest-Another-RPG. Therefore, I added an additional class js file to handle all of that. 

I took inspiration from the profile generator of Module 9 for the rest of the challenge, since that was where I had most experience writing and copying html onto a page. Using similar functions, I created the markdown, write, and copy functions, placing them in their own utils and src folders. I went ahead and also copied the CSS file provided in module 9 and added minor changes, such as background color to fit my need. I decided not to remove unapplied classes so that, in the future, should I choose to alter the CSS, it will be easier to adapt. After some tinkering, I managed to display the information properly.  -->



## Installation

<!-- Links to the repository and deployed website can be found at [Questions](#questions).

Because this project runs from the machine and not the browser, it cannot be deployed. The project is on github, however. You must first clone the repo, then run the command "npm install" on the Terminal/Command Line in order to download the dependencies. Make sure to also download inquirer, using "npm install inquirer". From there, you can fill out your team. If you want to run tests, you also have to install Jest, using "npm install jest --save-dev". -->


## Usage

<!-- Once the project is cloned and the dependencies downloaded, type "node index" to run the program. The program will provide you with multiple prompts to fill out. When you're done, your new webpage should appear in the dist/ folder for you to open up onto your preferred browser. 

Screenshots of the mockup and actual site are shown below

## Credits

<!-- The coding boot camp Professional README Guide found at https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide was used as a template for this README. The license was picked from [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).The WHEN/THEN section of this README was based off the project assignment Acceptance Criteria. No TAs or classmates were used in the making of this challenge. Most influence was taken particularly from Jest-Another-RPG of Module 10 and the Portfolio Generator from Module 9. Stack Overflow, MDN Web Docs, W3, and Google were critical to my success. Node.js, Jest, and NPM's Inquirer were also used. -->



## Contributing

<!-- Other items to be added can be more classes of employee, such as junior developer, salesperson, or whatever other job may be offered at the organization in question. Speaking of which, a class could be made for the organization as a whole. Addesses, resumes, salaries, PTO, age, social security number, direct deposit, and much more can be added to the input, as long as the more private information is handled with the respective care. Styling can also be improved.  -->


## Tests

<!-- Tests were created using Jest. Currently, there are 22 tests, and all of them pass. More tests can be added to further fill out the 4 classes currently available. To run a test, type "npm run test /CLASS/" to run the tests associated with a specific class (labeled /CLASS/ in the example). -->
